# Datacamp: A Collection of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
A collection of data science and machine learning projects from my Datacamp.


Welcome to my Datacamp Progress repo! This repository contains my work on various datacamp projects. Each folder represents a unique project where I explore data, apply machine learning algorithms, and extract meaningful insights. This collection is a testament to my continuous learning and passion for data science.
